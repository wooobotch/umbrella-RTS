# Umbrella Real Time Strategy

## A long time coming

I started studying and searching for solutions to run my all time loved AOE the way I want, modded as I want, when and where I want but I never found any that fullfilled my expectations:

- To be portable.
- To be clear.
- To be modular.
- Not using a cringy language or stack.
- Independent from a company's mood or agenda.

## Previous attempts

As you may have seen in that robocop sequence where they show every wrecked robocop's alpha version, many tools and languages failed:

- Unreal, a flamethrower to toast some bread.
- Unity, 2GB "hello wolrd".
- Pygame, python.
- SDL, not yet there.

That's the oversimplifyed version of the story.

## The choice

For me it was OpenGL and I was making excuses to do something with it at the same time y was posponing it.
BTW, my first programming language ever was C, then I jumped into C++ because someone told me so (I was 15 XD).
2 + 2 ends up adding what we all know.

Regardless what anyone says, that's the winning combo:
[X] Portability 
[X] Easy to read
[X] Modularity
[X] Virile
[X] Phrygian

## So, what now

First we need some dependencies/packages, keep in mind that I'm not using an IDE.

build-essential
cmake
git
libglfw3-dev
libglfw3
libglew-dev
libglm-dev
libxrandr-dev
libxinerama-dev
libxcursor-dev
libxi-dev
mesa-utils

build-essential, cmake and git are quite standard; libglfw3-dev, to manage windows and user inputs; libglm-dev for 3D math; libglew-dev, OpenGL functions.
Then mesa-utils just to test OpenGL.

After installing all that, shoot:
glxinfo | grep "OpenGL version"

You should get anything but an empty line or an error.

## Further considerations

I'm a native castellano speaker and also cordob√©s, so you should expect not just a spanish-ish writing but also gibberish everywhere, I'll try to keep it as readable as possible.
This is a personal project and I encourage everyone to manage their own things, I'm also helping some friends going further with C++ (assume it's them who are getting more of my attention).
All the code was a mess split across directories, different computers and even handwritten pieces of paper, I'm abusing the power of midlife crisis to get it all togheter, be patient.

Love and regards, yours
